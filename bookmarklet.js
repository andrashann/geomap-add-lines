[0] and [1] are ids of the cache. [2] and [3] are coordinates. [4] is the
type of the cache. [5] is the status (can be found?). [6] is the point id. 
[7] is the name of the cache. [8] is find status (N = not yet found by the
logged in user; everything is N if not logged in). [9] is the point type
(M = starting point of a multi-cache, T = additional point of a multi-cache),
[10] is a one-field summary of [8] and [9].
